The Wolverines joined the Big Ten Conference at its inception in 1896, and other than a hiatus from 1907 to 1916, have been members since. Michigan has won or shared 43 league titles, and since the inception of the AP Poll in 1936, has finished in the top 10 a total of 39 times.

        "strDescriptionEN": "The Michigan Wolverines Men's Basketball team is the intercollegiate men's basketball program representing the University of Michigan. The school competes in the Big Ten Conference in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The Wolverines play home basketball games at the Crisler Center in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Michigan has won one NCAA Championship as well as two National Invitation Tournaments (NIT), fourteen Big Ten Conference titles and two Big Ten Tournament titles. In addition, it has \"won\" an NIT title and \"won\" a Big Ten Tournament that were vacated due to NCAA sanctions. The team is coached by Juwan Howard.\r\n\r\nMichigan has had 31 All-Americans, selected 44 times. Eight of these have been consensus All-Americans, which are Cazzie Russell (two times), Rickey Green, Gary Grant, Chris Webber, Trey Burke, as well as Harry Kipke, Richard Doyle and Bennie Oosterbaan (two-times) who were retroactively selected by the Helms Foundation. Twelve All-Americans have been at least two-time honorees. Russell was the only three-time All-American.\r\n\r\nMichigan basketball players have been successful in professional basketball. Fifty-eight have been drafted into the National Basketball Association (NBA); twenty-six of those were first round draft picks, including both Cazzie Russell and Chris Webber who were drafted first overall. The 1990 NBA draft in which Rumeal Robinson was selected 10th, Loy Vaught was selected 13th, and Terry Mills was selected 16th made Michigan the third of only ten schools that have ever had three or more players selected in the first round of the same draft. Five players have gone on to become NBA champions for a total of nine times and eight players have become NBA All-Stars a total of 18 times. Rudy Tomjanovich coached both the 1994 and 1995 NBA Finals Champions. Glen Rice is one of only nine basketball players to have won a state high school championship, NCAA title and NBA championship.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1990s Michigan endured an NCAA violations scandal, described as involving one of the largest amounts of illicit money in NCAA history, when Ed Martin loaned four players a reported total of $616,000. Due to NCAA sanctions, records from the 1992 Final Four, the 1992\u201393 season, and 1995\u201399 seasons have been vacated. Throughout this article asterisks denote awards, records and honors that have been vacated.",

The team is coached by Mike Elko and play their home games at Wallace Wade Stadium in Durham, North Carolina.\r\n\r\nAfter struggling for most of the time since the mid-1960s, the Blue Devils underwent a renaissance under David Cutcliffe (2008\u20132021). Duke secured their first Coastal division title on November 30, 2013 with a win over arch-rival North Carolina. Additionally, the Blue Devils cracked the top 25 of the BCS standings, the AP Poll, and the Coaches' Poll during the 2013 season and very nearly scored an upset over a potent Texas A&M team in the 2013 Chick-fil-A Bowl, losing by only four points after jumping out to a 38\u201317 lead at halftime. In 2014, Duke followed up with a nine win season, including a victory over eventual Orange Bowl winner Georgia Tech, and another close bowl loss to 15th-ranked Arizona State in the Sun Bowl. In 2015, the Blue Devils broke through for a 44\u201341 overtime win over Indiana in the Pinstripe Bowl at Yankee Stadium, and followed up with a win over Northern Illinois in the 2017 Quick Lane Bowl.",

Florida competes in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the Eastern Division of the Southeastern Conference (SEC). They play their home games in Steve Spurrier-Florida Field at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium on the university's Gainesville campus.\r\n\r\nFlorida's football program was established along with the university in 1906, took on the \"Gators\" nickname in 1911, began playing in newly constructed Florida Field in 1930, and joined the Southeastern Conference as a founding member in 1932. On the field, the Gators found intermittent success during the first half of the 20th century, with a highlight being the 1928 squad that went 8\u20131 and led the nation in scoring. Florida football enjoyed its first sustained success in the 1960s under head coach Ray Graves. After having appeared in only two sanctioned bowl games up to that time, Grave's Gators won four during the decade, and quarterback Steve Spurrier became the school's first Heisman Trophy winner in 1966.\r\n\r\nSpurrier returned to his alma mater as the Gators' head ball coach in 1990, and the program has been among the top in college football since then. Since 1990, Florida has won three national championships (in 1996 under Spurrier and in 2006 and 2008 under Urban Meyer), eight conference titles, fifteen SEC East division titles, and sixteen bowl games, and Florida squads have finished the season ranked in the top-10 fifteen times. In addition, quarterbacks Danny Wuerffel and Tim Tebow won the Heisman in 1996 and 2007, respectively.",

The program is classified in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I Bowl Subdivision (FBS), and the team competes in the Big 12 Conference. The head coach is Les Miles who became the coach following the 2018 season.\r\n\r\nThe program's first season was 1890, making it one of the oldest college football teams in the country. The team's home field is David Booth Kansas Memorial Stadium, which opened in 1921 and is the seventh-oldest college football stadium in the nation. Until 2014, Memorial Stadium was one of the few football stadiums in Division I that had a track encircling the field. The track was removed in 2014, as the University's newly built Rock Chalk Park sports complex gave way to new sports facilities for other athletic's team. In 2019, immediately adjacent to the west of the stadium, the University of Kansas Football Indoor Practice Facility was completed. The facility was built using only private donations from University of Kansas alumni, most notably David Booth.  KU's all-time record was 585\u2013640\u201358 as of the conclusion of the 2018 season. The program saw a re-emergence under head coach Mark Mangino who won 50 games in eight seasons. After Magino's departure the program quickly declined winning only 15 games in the eight seasons after he left the program.\r\n\r\nWhile Kansas has yet to have a Heisman Trophy winner, they have had one Heisman finalist and 2 other players receive votes. John Hadl, Bobby Douglass, and David Jaynes all received votes, Jaynes being the only finalist. Other notable former Kansas players include Pro Football Hall of Famers Gale Sayers, John Riggins, and Mike McCormack, as well as All-Americans Nolan Cromwell, Dana Stubblefield, Aqib Talib, and Anthony Collins. Kansas has appeared in twelve bowl games, including three trips to the Orange Bowl (1948, 1969, and 2008). Kansas played in the first NCAA-contracted nationally televised regular season college football game on September 20, 1952, against TCU.\r\n\r\nAlong with Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska, and Washington University in St. Louis, Kansas was a charter member of the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association in 1907, which evolved into the Big Eight Conference. The Big Eight was folded into the Big 12 in 1996, and Kansas is the only original member of the MVIAA that is still part of the Big 12.",

Coach Fran McCaffery is the current head coach, and has been at Iowa since 2010.\r\n\r\nThe Hawkeyes have played in 26 NCAA Tournaments, eight NIT Tournaments, won eight Big Ten regular-season conference championships and won the Big Ten tournament twice. Iowa has played in the Final Four on three occasions, reaching the semifinals in 1955 and 1980 and playing in the championship game against the University of San Francisco in 1956.\r\n\r\nIowa basketball was widely successful in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s with a program resurgence under Lute Olson and the tenures of George Raveling and Tom Davis. Under Olson, the Hawkeyes won their last Big Ten regular season championship and went to the 1980 Final Four.\r\n\r\nThey currently play in 15,400-seat Carver-Hawkeye Arena, along with Iowa women's basketball, wrestling, and volleyball teams.\r\n\r\nPrior to playing in Carver-Hawkeye Arena, which opened in 1983, the Hawkeyes played in the Iowa Armory and the Iowa Field House, which is still used today by the school's gymnastics teams. In 2006, the Hawkeyes accumulated a school-record 21 consecutive wins at home before losing to in-state rival Northern Iowa.\r\n\r\nFour Iowa coaches have been inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame: Sam Barry, Ralph Miller, Lute Olson and George Raveling.",

        "strDescriptionEN": "The Alabama Crimson Tide men's basketball team represents the University of Alabama in NCAA Division I men's basketball. The program plays in the Southeastern Conference (SEC). In the conference it trails only long-time basketball powerhouse Kentucky in SEC tournament titles, is third behind Kentucky and Arkansas in wins, and is also third behind Kentucky and LSU in SEC regular season conference titles. Alabama was retroactively recognized as the pre-NCAA Tournament national champion for the 1929\u201330 season by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll.\r\n\r\nThe men's basketball program has spent most of its history in the shadow of Alabama's football team, but has risen in stature over the past several decades. Under former coach Mark Gottfried, the team achieved a No. 1 national ranking briefly in 2003, and competed for an NCAA Regional Tournament Championship in 2004. The program was notable as a regular conference basketball contender in the 1980s and early 1990s under the direction of coach Wimp Sanderson and in the 1970s under coach C. M. Newton. Alabama has eight NCAA Tournament Sweet 16 appearances. In the 2003\u201304 season, the team defeated #1-seeded Stanford in the NCAA Tournament, and reached the Elite Eight round where they lost to the eventual national champion, Connecticut.",

        "strDescriptionEN": "The North Carolina Tar Heels football team represents the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the sport of American football. The Tar Heels play in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the Coastal Division of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC).\r\n\r\nNorth Carolina has played in 35 bowl games in its history and won three Southern Conference championships and five Atlantic Coast Conference titles. Thirty Tar Heel players have been honored as first-team All-Americas on 38 occasions. Carolina had 32 All-Southern Conference selections when it played in that league until 1952 and since joining the ACC in 1953, has had 174 first-team All-ACC choices. Since joining the Atlantic Coast Conference in 1953, the team has won five conference championships, with the most recent title coming in 1980.\r\n\r\nOne very important contribution to the game of football by Carolina is the modern use of the forward pass; they were the first college team to use the play in 1895. Bob Quincy notes in his 1973 book They Made the Bell Tower Chime: \"John Heisman, a noted historian, wrote 30 years later that, indeed, the Tar Heels had given birth to the forward pass against the Bulldogs (UGA). It was conceived to break a scoreless deadlock and give UNC a 6\u20130 win. The Tar Heels were in a punting situation and a Georgia rush seemed destined to block the ball. The punter, with an impromptu dash to his right, tossed the ball and it was caught by George Stephens, who ran 70 yards for a touchdown.\"\r\n\r\nThe program has long been overshadowed by the school's powerhouse men's basketball team. While not a consistent football powerhouse, the Carolina football program has had intermittent success and has featured a number of great players, many of whom have gone on to prominence in the National Football League, including Lawrence Taylor, Charlie Justice, Chris Hanburger, Ken Willard, Don McCauley, William Fuller, Harris Barton, Jeff Saturday, Alge Crumpler, Willie Parker, Greg Ellis, Dr\u00e9 Bly, Julius Peppers, Hakeem Nicks, and Mitch Trubisky.",

        "strDescriptionEN": "The Clemson Tigers are the American football team at Clemson University. The Tigers compete in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the Atlantic Division (divisions were dissolved in 2023) of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). In recent years, the Tigers have been ranked among the most elite college football programs in the United States.\r\n\r\nFormed in 1896, the program has an all-time record of 790\u2013466\u201344, with a bowl record of 28\u201322. Clemson was a College Football Playoff finalist in 2015, 2016, 2018, and 2019, defeating Alabama in both 2016 and 2018 to secure the national title. Clemson has had six undefeated seasons (including the first-ever 15\u20130 team), boasted six consecutive playoff appearances from 2015 to 2021, and retains 27 conference championships, including 8 since 2011. Its alumni includes over 100 All-Americans, 17 Academic All-Americans and over 250 players in the National Football League. Clemson has had eight members inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame: players Banks McFadden, Terry Kinard, Jeff Davis, and C. J. Spiller along with coaches John Heisman, Jess Neely, Frank Howard, and Danny Ford.\r\n\r\nClemson's streak of eleven consecutive 10-win seasons ranks second in active streaks behind the Alabama Crimson Tide.\r\n\r\nClemson is one of the founding members of the ACC and holds 21 ACC titles, the most of any member. Its 27 total conference titles, including six consecutive ACC titles from 2015 to 2020, are the most of any ACC school. Clemson's most recent ACC title came in 2022, against North Carolina.\r\n\r\nAmong its eight undefeated regular seasons, Clemson was crowned poll-era national champions and finished with its third perfect season with a win over Nebraska in the 1982 Orange Bowl, and was the National Championship Finalist Runner-up with a 14\u20131 record in 2015. The following season, Clemson won the National Title over No. 1 Alabama in college football's first National Championship rematch in 2016, and again in 2018. The Tigers have 46 bowl appearances, 20 of which are among the New Year's Six Bowls, including nine during the \"Big Four\" era. Clemson has 34 finishes in the final top 25 in the modern era and it finished in either the Associated Press final poll or the coaches' final poll a combined 59 times since 1939.\r\n\r\nThe Tigers play their home games in Memorial Stadium on the university's Clemson, South Carolina campus. The stadium's nickname, \"Death Valley\" was coined in 1948 by Presbyterian College head coach Lonnie McMillan after his teams were routinely defeated there. Memorial Stadium is among the largest stadiums in college football.",

        "strDescriptionEN": "The Texas Longhorns men's basketball team represents The University of Texas at Austin in NCAA Division I intercollegiate men's basketball competition. The Longhorns currently compete in the Big 12 Conference.\r\n\r\nThe University of Texas began varsity intercollegiate competition in men's basketball in 1906. The Longhorns rank 18th in total victories among all NCAA Division I college basketball programs and 25th in all-time win percentage among programs with at least 60 years in Division I, with an all-time win-loss record of 1791\u20131088 (.622). Among Big 12 Conference men's basketball programs, Texas is second only to Kansas in both all-time wins and all-time win percentage.\r\n\r\nThe Longhorns have won 27 total conference championships in men's basketball and have made 34 total appearances in the NCAA Tournament (11th-most appearances all time, with a 35\u201337 overall record), reaching the NCAA Final Four three times (1943, 1947, 2003) and the NCAA Regional Finals (Elite Eight) seven times. As of the end of the 2017\u201318 season, Texas ranks sixth among all Division I men's basketball programs for total NCAA Tournament games won without having won the national championship (35), trailing Kansas State (37), Notre Dame (38), Purdue (39), Illinois (40), and Oklahoma (41).\r\n\r\nThe Texas basketball program experienced substantial success during the early decades of its existence, but its success in the modern era is of relatively recent vintage. After two losing seasons during the program's first five years, Texas suffered only one losing season from 1912 to 1950, achieving a winning percentage of .703 during that span, reaching two Final Fours and one Elite Eight during the first decade of the NCAA Tournament, and receiving retroactive recognition as the 1933 national champion from the Premo-Porretta Power Poll; from 1951 to 1988, the Longhorns finished with losing records 14 times, recorded a winning percentage of .522, and participated in the expanded Tournament only five times. Texas achieved some measures of national recognition during the tenures of head coaches Abe Lemons (1976\u201382) and Tom Penders (1988\u201398), but the program rose to its highest level of prominence under the direction of former head coach Rick Barnes (1998\u20132015). Barnes guided Texas to 16 NCAA Tournament appearances in his 17 seasons with the program, including a school-record fourteen consecutive appearances (1999\u20132012), as well as fifteen 20-win seasons overall and a school-best thirteen consecutive 20-win seasons (2000\u201312).\r\n\r\nSince 1977, the team has played its home games in the Frank Erwin Special Events Center, where it has compiled a record of 507\u2013126 (.801) as of January 7, 2019. The team is currently led by fourth-year head coach Shaka Smart.",

The Hoosiers play on Branch McCracken Court at Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall in Bloomington, Indiana on the Indiana University Bloomington campus. Indiana has won five NCAA Championships in men's basketball (1940, 1953, 1976, 1981, 1987) \u2013 the first two under coach Branch McCracken and the latter three under Bob Knight. Indiana's 1976 squad remains the last undefeated NCAA men's basketball champion.\r\n\r\nThe Hoosiers are tied for sixth in NCAA Tournament appearances (39), seventh in NCAA Tournament victories (66), tied for eighth in Final Four appearances (8), and 11th in overall victories. The Hoosiers have won 22 Big Ten Conference Championships and have the best winning percentage in conference games at nearly 60 percent. No team has had more All-Big Ten selections than the Hoosiers with 53. The Hoosiers also rank seventh in all-time AP poll appearances (560) and sixth in the number of weeks spent ranked No. 1 (54). Every four-year men's basketball letterman since 1973 has earned a trip to the NCAA basketball tournament. Additionally, every four-year player since 1950 has played on a nationally ranked squad at Indiana.\r\n\r\nThe Hoosiers are among the most storied programs in the history of college basketball. A 2019 study listed Indiana as the fifth most valuable collegiate basketball program in the country. Indiana has ranked in the top 20 nationally in men's basketball attendance every season since Assembly Hall opened in 1972, and often in the top five.\r\n\r\nIndiana has two main rivalries including in-state, against the Purdue Boilermakers (see Indiana\u2013Purdue rivalry), and out-of-state, against the Kentucky Wildcats (see Indiana\u2013Kentucky rivalry.)",

        "strDescriptionEN": "The Ohio State Buckeyes football team competes as part of the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision, representing Ohio State University in the East Division of the Big Ten Conference. Ohio State has played their home games at Ohio Stadium in Columbus, Ohio since 1922. The Buckeyes are recognized by the university and NCAA as having won eight national championships along with 41 conference championships (including 39 Big Ten titles), 10 division championships, 10 undefeated seasons, and six perfect seasons (no losses or ties). Seven players have received the Heisman Trophy (second all-time), with the program holding the distinction of having the only two-time winner of the award.\r\n\r\nThe first Ohio State game was a 20\u201314 victory over Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware, Ohio, on May 3, 1890. The team was a football independent from 1890 to 1901 before joining the Ohio Athletic Conference (OAC) as a charter member in 1902. The Buckeyes won two conference championships while members of the OAC and in 1912 became members of the Big Ten Conference.\r\n\r\nOhio State won their first national championship in 1942 under head coach Paul Brown. Following World War II, Ohio State saw sparse success on the football field with three separate coaches and in 1951 hired Woody Hayes to coach the team. Under Hayes, Ohio State won over 200 games, were selected five times as national champions, from various pollsters, including three (1954, 1957, 1968) from major wire-service: AP Poll and Coaches' Poll. Additionally, his Buckeye teams captured 13 Big Ten conference championships, and eight Rose Bowl appearances. Following Hayes' dismissal in 1978, Earle Bruce won 4 Big Ten titles (1979, 1981, 1984, 1986) and later John Cooper coached the team to 3 conference championships (1993, 1996, 1998).\r\n\r\nJim Tressel was hired as head coach in 2001 and led Ohio State to its seventh national championship in 2002. Under Tressel, Ohio State won seven Big Ten championships and appeared in eight Bowl Championship Series (BCS) games, winning five of them. Urban Meyer became head coach in 2011. Under Meyer, the team went 12\u20130 in his first season and set a school record with 24 consecutive victories, won three Big Ten championships (2014, 2017, and 2018), and won the first College Football Playoff National Championship in 2014. Current head coach Ryan Day took over in 2019, and thus far has led the team to two Big Ten titles (2019, 2020) and three berths in the College Football Playoff (2019, 2020, 2022)\r\n\r\nAs of 2017, the football program is valued at $1.5 - 2 billion, the highest valuation of any such program in the country.",

The Hurricanes compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I Football Bowl Subdivision and the Coastal Division of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). The program began in 1926 and has won five AP national championships (1983, 1987, 1989, 1991, 2001).\r\n\r\nThe Miami Hurricanes are among the most storied and decorated football programs in NCAA history. Miami is ranked fourth on the list of all-time Associated Press National Poll Championships, tied with USC and Ohio State and behind Alabama, Notre Dame, and Oklahoma. Two Hurricanes (Vinny Testaverde in 1986 and Gino Toretta in 1992) have won the Heisman Trophy. Twelve College Football Hall of Fame members either played or coached at the University of Miami: Bennie Blades, Don Bosseler, Ted Hendricks, Don James (played at Miami but was inducted as a coach), Russell Maryland, Ed Reed, Vinny Testaverde, Gino Torretta, Arnold Tucker, and coaches Andy Gustafson, Jack Harding, Dennis Erickson and Jimmy Johnson.\r\n\r\nMiami also holds a number of NFL Draft records, including most first-round selections in a single draft and most consecutive drafts with at least one first-round selection. As of 2022, at least one University of Miami player has been selected in the NFL Draft in 48 consecutive NFL drafts, dating back to 1975. Among all colleges and universities, as of 2022, the University of Miami holds the all-time record for the most defensive linemen (49) and is tied with USC for the most wide receivers (40) to go on to play in the NFL. To date, nine Miami Hurricanes have been inducted into the NFL's Pro Football Hall of Fame, Jim Otto in 1980, Ted Hendricks in 1990, Jim Kelly in 2002, Michael Irvin in 2007, Cortez Kennedy in 2012, Warren Sapp in 2013, Ray Lewis in 2018, Ed Reed in 2019, and Edgerrin James in 2020.\r\n\r\nAs of the end of the 2021 season, the Miami Hurricanes have a compiled record of 644\u2013370\u201319 since the program's 1926 launch.\r\n\r\nSince 2008, the University of Miami has played its home games at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, roughly 22 miles (35 km) north of the university's primary campus in Coral Gables. Prior to 2008, from 1937 until 2007, Miami played their home games at the Miami Orange Bowl, which was demolished in 2008.",

The Knights compete in the Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and are a member of the Big 12 Conference in July of 2023, making UCF the youngest school among the Power Five conferences. Their head coach is Gus Malzahn. The Knights play their home games at the 45,301-seat FBC Mortgage Stadium, which is located on UCF's main campus near Orlando, Florida, United States. \r\n\r\nUCF first fielded a varsity football team in the fall of 1979 as an NCAA Division III program and subsequently completed their ascension to Division I\u2013A, now known as the Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), in 1996, becoming the first program in NCAA history to have played in all four divisions of football (and the only one until James Madison joined FBS in 2022). As a Division I\u2013AA program, the Knights made the 1990 and 1993 playoffs, and were picked as the preseason No. 1 team to start the 1994 season.\r\n\r\nAs of the end of the 2021 season, UCF has compiled 278 victories, six division titles, six conference championships, and an undefeated season in 2017. The Knights claim a national championship for the 2017 season despite being excluded from that season's College Football Playoff, as they were chosen as the #1 team by the Colley Matrix.\r\n\r\nThe Knights have made 14 postseason appearances since joining the FBS, including winning two New Year's Six bowls: the 2014 Fiesta Bowl and the 2018 Peach Bowl. The program has produced one Consensus All-American, Kevin Smith in 2007, and three Heisman Trophy candidates, Daunte Culpepper (QB) in 1998, Kevin Smith (RB) in 2007, and McKenzie Milton (QB) in 2017 and 2018. UCF has produced a long line of accomplished NFL players, including Blake Bortles, A. J. Bouye, Gabe Davis, Shaquill Griffin, Charley Hughlett, Brandon Marshall, Latavius Murray, Matt Prater, Asante Samuel, and Josh Sitton. UCF has had four first-round picks in the NFL Draft, 16 Super Bowl players, and seven pro-bowlers. The Knights' main rivals are the South Florida Bulls.",

The Lobos won the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) championship in 1964 and 1968, making frequent appearances in national rankings. The team reached the NIT tournament final in 1964 and received its first bid to the NCAA tournament in 1968.

The Zips are currently coached by John Groce. Prior to becoming members of the MAC in 1992, the Zips were members of the Ohio Valley Conference and the Mid-Continent Conference.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, the Zips officially announced they had signed a three-year partnership to be outfitted by the LeBron James line by Nike. They are now the only team with a LJ23/Nike contract. Nike has released several Zips themed versions of LeBron's shoes. Some are available to the public, while others are exclusively for the members of the basketball team.\r\n\r\nThe team first played in the NCAA Tournament in 1986 when Bob Huggins was their coach. The Zips won their first MAC East division title in 1998. In 2006, the Zips received an invitation to the NIT and won their first-ever post season game at Temple University before falling in the second round. In 2007, the team won their second MAC East title and tied the school record for wins in a season in the Division I era with 26. They also made their first-ever appearance in the MAC Tournament Championship game, which they lost on a last-second shot 53\u201352 to the Miami RedHawks. The loss cost them the MAC's automatic berth and they were subsequently not selected for either the 2007 NCAA Tournament or NIT, despite finishing with a 26\u20137 record. The Zips posted a 24\u201311 record (11\u20135 in the MAC) in 2008 which included a second-straight appearance in the MAC tournament championship game and a berth in the 2008 National Invitation Tournament.",

The Horned Frogs play their home games in Amon G. Carter Stadium, which is located on the TCU campus in Fort Worth. TCU began playing football in 1896 and has been a member of the Big 12 Conference since 2012. They were previously members of the Mountain West Conference (MWC), Western Athletic Conference (WAC), Conference USA (C-USA), Southwest Conference (SWC), and Texas Intercollegiate Athletic Association (TIAA).\r\n\r\nThe Horned Frogs claim national championships in 1935 and 1938, when they were led by Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Sammy Baugh and Heisman Trophy winner Davey O'Brien, respectively. In addition to Baugh and O'Brien, TCU has had six other former players inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. Following decades of futility during the late 20th century, TCU returned to national prominence under head coach Dennis Franchione (1998-2000). Franchione led the Horned Frogs to their first bowl game win and AP poll finish since the 1950s. TCU enjoyed further success under Franchione's successor, Gary Patterson (2001-2021). Patterson led the Horned Frogs to ten seasons of 11 or more wins, including a perfect 2010 season, six AP top 10 finishes, and a share of the 2014 Big 12 conference championship. Sonny Dykes would replace Patterson in 2022 and lead TCU to their first College Football Playoff berth. They defeated Michigan in the Fiesta Bowl semifinal and advanced to the national championship, where they lost to Georgia.\r\n\r\nTCU ranks 4th all time in final AP poll points among private schools, behind Notre Dame, USC, and Miami-FL. The Horned Frogs are also one of only four FBS teams to have played in all six College Football Playoff Bowls, winning all but the Orange.",

The current head coach is Mark Fox, who began his tenure at Cal in 2019.\r\n\r\nThe team plays its home games at Haas Pavilion, which was long known as Harmon Gym before being heavily renovated with money donated in part by the owners of Levi Strauss & Co. The arena was originally known as Men's Gymnasium and then later Harmon Gymnasium until the late 1990s when it went through renovations which displaced the team for two seasons.",

The program is classified in the Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), and the team competes in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC).\r\n\r\nSyracuse is considered one of the most prestigious college basketball programs in the country with 3 overall claimed National Championships and 1 NCAA Tournament championship, as well being a National Runner-up 2 times and currently holding an active NCAA-record of 49 consecutive winning seasons. Syracuse is ranked sixth in total victories among all NCAA Division I programs and seventh in all-time win percentage among programs with at least 50 years in Division I, with an all-time win-loss record of 2008\u2013908\u2020 (.689) as of March 20, 2019. The Orange are also sixth in NCAA Tournament appearances (40), seventh in NCAA Tournament victories (68\u2020), and eighth in Final Four appearances (6).\r\n\r\nThe Orange play their home games at the Carrier Dome. The Carrier Dome is the largest arena in NCAA DI basketball with a maximum capacity of 35,446. Syracuse's home court total attendance has led the nation 25 times, and its per-game season average attendance has been ranked first 14 times since the opening of the Carrier Dome in 1980. The most recent record-breaking game was against Duke in 2019 with the crowd of 35,642 people. The Carrier Dome is often considered one of the best home court advantages in college basketball.\r\n\r\nIn its 42nd year under current head coach Jim Boeheim, the team has compiled an all-time record 38 20-win seasons, including 10 Big East regular season championships, 5 Big East Tournament championships, 34 NCAA Tournament appearances (and 40 all-time), and 3 appearances in the national title game.\r\n\r\nIn 2015, after a lengthy investigation, the NCAA's Committee on Infractions ordered Syracuse to vacate 101 wins from five different seasons. However, the NCAA confirmed that sanctions did not include the removal of any trophies or banners. Therefore, Syracuse claims all of its NCAA Tournaments appearances and conference titles from those years.",

        "strDescriptionEN": "The Stanford Cardinal football program represents Stanford University in college football at the NCAA Division I FBS level and is a member of the Pac-12 Conference's North Division. The team is known as the Cardinal, adopted prior to the 1982 season. Stanford was known as the \"Cardinal\" for its first two decades of athletic competition, then more commonly as the \"Cardinals\" until 1930. The name was changed to the \"Indians\" from 1930 to January 1972, and back to the \"Cardinals\" from 1972 through 1981. A student vote in December 1975 to change the nickname to \"Robber Barons\" was not approved by administrators.\r\n\r\nStanford has fielded football teams every year since 1892 with a few exceptions. Like a number of other teams from the era concerned with violence in the sport, the school dropped football in favor of rugby from 1906 to 1917. The school also did not field a team in 1918 (due to World War I) or in 1943, 1944, and 1945 (due to World War II).\r\n\r\nThe school participated in the first-ever Rose Bowl against Michigan in 1902, in which they were routed 49\u20130. Its annual Big Game against California is the oldest and most storied rivalry in the Pac-12 and western United States. The Cardinal also compete for the Legends Trophy against independent rival Notre Dame.\r\n\r\nThe program has an all-time record of 664\u2013478\u201349 for a winning percentage of .578 and has winning series records against all of its Pac-12 North rivals, except for the Washington Huskies, against whom they are tied 43\u201343\u20134. Stanford claimed national championships in 1926 and 1940. In 1926, led by legendary coach Glenn \"Pop\" Warner, the team was undefeated in the regular season and tied Alabama in the 1927 Rose Bowl. The 1940 team went unbeaten and untied after defeating Nebraska 21\u201313 in the 1941 Rose Bowl, but the team ranked No. 2 in the final AP poll released before the game was played.\r\n\r\nPop Warner's era predated the AP poll, but Stanford has finished at least one season in the Top 10 in six different decades under seven different coaches: Claude E. Thornhill in 1934, Clark Shaughnessy in 1940, Chuck Taylor in 1951, John Ralston in 1970 and 1971, Bill Walsh in 1992, Jim Harbaugh in 2010, and David Shaw in 2011, 2012, and 2015. Coach Shaw, as of the 2017 season, has the most wins of any Stanford coach in history. Stanford's most recent season finish in the top 5 was in 2015 after the No. 5 Cardinal dismantled Big Ten West Division Champion No. 6 Iowa Hawkeyes 45\u201316 in the 2016 Rose Bowl to finish with a record of 12\u20132 (Stanford's third 12-win season ever, after 2010 and 2012) and a final ranking of No. 3 in the final AP Poll and the final Coaches Poll (Stanford's highest AP Poll ranking since 1940 and its highest Coaches Poll ranking ever).\r\n\r\nThe Cardinal have played in 30 bowl games in their history, including 17 appearances in bowls now comprising the College Football Playoff, specifically 15 Rose Bowls (the third-most appearances of any team, behind only USC's 33 appearances and Michigan's 22), the 2011 Orange Bowl, and the 2012 Fiesta Bowl.\r\n\r\nQuarterback Jim Plunkett is the only Stanford player to win the Heisman Trophy, doing so in 1970. Stanford players have finished second in Heisman voting six times: quarterback John Elway was second to Herschel Walker in 1982; running back Toby Gerhart was second to Mark Ingram II in 2009; quarterback Andrew Luck finished second to Cam Newton in 2010 and to Robert Griffin III in 2011; running back Christian McCaffrey finished second to Derrick Henry in 2015; and running back Bryce Love finished second to Baker Mayfield in 2017.",

The team is currently coached by Brian Kelly and plays its home games at the campus's Notre Dame Stadium, which has a capacity of 77,622.  Notre Dame is one of six schools that competes as an Independent at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Football Bowl Subdivision level; however, they play five games a year against opponents from the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), which Notre Dame is a member of in all other sports except ice hockey.\r\n\r\nNotre Dame is one of the most iconic and successful programs in college football. The school claims 11 national championships, but the NCAA recognizes the school with 13.  Moreover, Notre Dame has 21 national championships recognized by all major selectors; this is tied with Alabama for the most in the FBS.  Notre Dame and Ohio State share the record of seven Heisman Trophy winners, but Notre Dame leads Ohio State by the number of individual winners. Notre Dame has produced 101 consensus All-Americans, 34 unanimous All-Americans, 52 members of the College Football Hall of Fame, and 13 members of the NFL Hall of Fame, all NCAA records. Notre Dame has had 495 players selected in the NFL Draft, second only to USC.\r\n\r\nAll Notre Dame home games have been televised by NBC since 1991, and Notre Dame is the only school to have such a contract.   It was the only independent program to be part of the Bowl Championship Series coalition and its guaranteed payout, and it has one of the largest, most widespread fan bases in college football. These factors help make Notre Dame one of the most financially valuable football programs in the country, which allows the school to remain an independent.",

The Seminoles have achieved three undefeated seasons, finished ranked in the top four of the AP Poll for 14 straight years from 1987 through 2000, and completed 41 straight winning seasons from 1977 through 2017; from 2012 through 2014, the team won 29 consecutive games, tied for the twelfth-longest winning streak in college football and tied for the longest winning streak in ACC history; from 1992 through 1995, the team also won 29 consecutive conference games, the longest winning streak in ACC history. The 1999 team received votes from ESPN as one of the top teams in college football history.\r\n\r\nThe team has produced three Heisman Trophy winners: quarterbacks Charlie Ward in 1993, Chris Weinke in 2000, and Jameis Winston in 2013. The Biletnikoff Award, presented annually to the top receiver in college football, is named for Florida State hall of Famer Fred Biletnikoff. Other awards won by Florida State players include the Walter Camp Award, the Maxwell Award, the Davey O'Brien Award, the Lombardi Award, the Dick Butkus Award, the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award, the Lou Groza Award, the Dave Rimington Trophy, and the Bobby Bowden Award. Florida State coaches have been honored with the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award, the Walter Camp Coach of the Year Award, the Home Depot Coach of the Year Award, the Broyles Award, and the Paul \"Bear\" Bryant Award. Many former Seminoles have gone on to have successful careers in the NFL.\r\n\r\nThe program has produced 219 All-Americans (45 consensuses and 15 unanimous) and 250 professional players. Florida State has had six members inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame, three members inducted into the College Football Coaches Hall of Fame, and five members inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\r\n\r\nThe Seminoles have the tenth-highest winning percentage among all college football programs in Division I FBS history with over 500 victories. Florida State has appeared in 50 postseason bowl games and ranks ninth nationally for bowl winning percentage and fourth for bowl wins. The Seminoles' archrivals are Florida, whom they meet annually in the last game of the regular season, and Miami; both games are considered among the greatest rivalries in college football. A rivalry with Clemson has developed and grown due to both teams competing yearly for the Atlantic division.\r\n\r\nThe team is coached by Mike Norvell and plays home games at Bobby Bowden Field at Doak Campbell Stadium, the 18th largest stadium in college football and the 2nd largest in the ACC, located on-campus in Tallahassee, Florida.",

The Bearkats have fielded a basketball team since 1917, excluding the 1942-43 and 1943-44 basketball seasons. Basketball was not played these years because World War II had decimated male enrollment at Sam Houston State. Success began early as Sam Houston went 43-11 during its first five years, including an unblemished 24-0 record during its first three.\r\nDuring the 21st Century, Sam Houston's men's basketball program boasts the second winning-est program in Texas Division I, only behind Texas. The Bearkats are also the winning-est program in the Southland Conference during the last decade.",

The Yellow Jackets play in Bobby Dodd Stadium at Historic Grant Field in Atlanta, which has a capacity of 55,000.\r\n\r\nOne of the most successful college football programs over a long history, the Yellow Jackets have won four national championships across four different decades (1917, 1928, 1952, 1990) as well as sixteen conference titles. Among the team's former coaches are John Heisman, for whom the Heisman Trophy is named, and Bobby Dodd, for whom the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award and the school's stadium are named. Heisman led the team to the most lopsided game in football history, 222\u20130, and both Heisman and Dodd led Tech's football team to national championships. Dodd also led the Jackets on their longest winning streak \u2014 8 straight games \u2014 against the University of Georgia in Tech's most time-endured rivalry, called Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate. For his part, Heisman led Georgia Tech to an undefeated 12\u20130\u20131 record in the Georgia Tech\u2013Clemson football rivalry and what made it sting even more was that Heisman had previously coached Clemson.\r\n\r\nA number of successful collegiate and professional football players have also played for Tech. The program has 48 first-team All-Americans and over 150 alumni who have played in the NFL. Among the most lauded and most notable players the school has produced are Maxie Baughan, Calvin Johnson, Demaryius Thomas, Keith Brooking, Joe Hamilton, Joe Guyon, Pat Swilling and Billy Shaw.\r\n\r\nIn the twenty-first century, Georgia Tech has won their Coastal Division and appeared in the ACC Championship Game four times since 2006. In addition to its conference and national championships, legendary coaches, and talented players, Tech's football program has been noted for its many bizarre traditions and improbable game finishes throughout the years.",

Maryland, a founding member of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), left the ACC in 2014 to join the Big Ten Conference.\r\nGary Williams, who coached the Terrapins from 1989 to 2011, led the program to its greatest success, including two consecutive Final Fours, which culminated in the 2002 NCAA National Championship. Under Williams, Maryland appeared in eleven straight NCAA Tournaments from 1994 to 2004. He retired in May 2011 and was replaced by former Texas A&M coach Mark Turgeon.\r\nThe Terrapins played in what many consider to be the greatest Atlantic Coast Conference game in history \u2014 and one of the greatest college basketball games ever \u2014 the championship of the 1974 ACC Men's Basketball Tournament, in which they lost 103\u2013100 in overtime to eventual national champion North Carolina State. The game was instrumental in forcing the expansion of the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship, thus allowing for at-large bids and the inclusion of more than one team per conference. That Maryland team, with six future NBA draft picks, is considered by many to be the greatest team not to have participated in the NCAA tournament.",

The program began in 1897 and has won four national championships (1956, 1976, 1984 and 2025). It is the only college football program in the nation to win national championships on three different levels of competition, NAIA, NCAA Division II, and NCAA Division I-AA (now FCS). Through the 2024 season, the Bobcats had played in 1,077 games with an all-time record of 548\u2013497\u201332.\r\n\r\nThe first championship came in Montana State's last season in the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference, which moved to NAIA in 1952. The national championship was the first ever for the RMAC and was also the first time the NAIA had a football champion. The Bobcats were members of the RMAC from 1917 to 1956, after being an independent from 1897 to 1916. MSC rejoined the NCAA (College Division) in 1957, and had one of its most successful runs as an independent from 1957 to 1962 with six straight winning seasons, including an 8\u20132 mark in 1957 and 8\u20131 in 1958. In 1963, Montana State became a charter member of the Big Sky Conference and has since won two national championships.\r\n\r\nMontana State has won 23 conference titles, including 18 in the Big Sky Conference and five in the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference. The Bobcats have won conference titles in eight of the past nine decades and have won multiple conference titles in seven of the last eight decades. MSU finished the 1926 season undefeated in RMAC conference games, but was not awarded a conference title. They have qualified for the NCAA playoffs thirteen times, once (1976) as a Division II member and thirteen times (1984, 2002, 2003, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014, 2018, 2019, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024) as a Division I-AA/FCS member. Through the 2024 season, the Bobcats are 21\u201314\u20132 in postseason play.\r\n\r\nTheir primary rival are the Montana Grizzlies, whom they meet in the annual Brawl of the Wild, more commonly referred to as the \"Cat-Griz\" game by MSU students, alumni and supporters.",

Residents of the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex generally consider North Texas to include the area south of Oklahoma, east of Abilene, west of Paris, and north of Waco. A more precise term for this region would be the northern part of the central portion of Texas. It does not include the Panhandle of Texas, which expands further north than the region previously described, nor does it include most of the region near the northern border of Texas.\r\n\r\nToday, North Texas is centered upon the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex, the largest metropolitan area in Texas and the Southern United States. People in the Dallas and Fort Worth areas sometimes use the terms \"Metroplex\", \"DFW\", and \"North Texas\" interchangeably. However, North Texas refers to a much larger area that includes many rural counties along the northern border.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nIndigenous tribes in North Texas included the Caddo, Tawakoni, Wichita, Kickapoo and Comanche. With European colonization, Mexican independence, and Texan independence and annexation to the United States, many of these tribes experienced demographic decline through relocation, slavery, etc. Since European colonization and the independence movements, the North Texas area was settled and most notably developed the cities of Dallas and Fort Worth.",

The team currently competes in the Ivy League in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and plays home games at the Lavietes Pavilion in Boston, Massachusetts. The team appeared in the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament in 2014, where Harvard upset 5-seed Cincinnati 61\u201357 before being eliminated in the round of 32 by 4-seed Michigan State by a score of 80\u201373. In 2015, Harvard tied with Yale for the Ivy title with an 11\u20133 league record. Despite having lost to Yale 62\u201352 at Lavietes Pavilion on March 6, 2015, just eight days later Harvard won a playoff between the two at the Palestra in Philadelphia to determine the Ivy League's NCAA automatic bid by a score of 53\u201351. Harvard thereby achieved its fourth straight NCAA Tournament appearance while preventing Yale from reaching the NCAA Tournament for the first time in 53 years. Harvard was eliminated from the 2015 NCAA Tournament by UNC by a score of 67\u201365 after leading with under one minute to play in the game.",

The Mountaineers have competed in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) and the Sun Belt Conference since 2014. Appalachian plays its home games in Kidd Brewer Stadium, named after former head coach Kidd Brewer, whose 1937 squad was unbeaten and unscored upon during the regular season.\r\n\r\nThe Mountaineers competed in the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) from its founding in 1978 to 2013. They won three straight national championships from 2005 to 2007, the first FCS team to do so since the playoffs began in 1978. They were also the first Division I program to win three consecutive national championships since Army accomplished the feat from 1944 to 1946, and the first Division I school in the modern era to claim three straight undisputed national titles. Appalachian became the first FCS team to receive votes in the final Associated Press (AP) college football poll on January 8, 2008. The Mountaineers received five points in the poll.\r\n\r\nThrough its storied history, the App State football program has won over 550 games, claimed three national championships and appeared in the Division-I FCS playoffs 20 times. The Mountaineers have 19 conference championships and boast one of the nation's best home field advantages. The program also has one Walter Payton Award winner, Armanti Edwards, who was the first player to win the award in back-to-back years (2008, 2009).",

In March 2014, the Mid-American Conference and UMass announced an agreement for the Minutemen to leave the conference after the 2015 season due to UMass declining an offer to become a full member of the conference. In the agreement between the MAC and the university, there was a contractual clause that had UMass playing in the MAC as a football-only member for two more seasons if UMass declined a full membership offer. UMass announced that it would look for a \"more suitable conference\" for the team. Possibilities included becoming independent or joining the American Athletic Conference, Conference USA, or the Sun Belt Conference.\r\n\r\nIn September 2014, UMass announced that they would become independent beginning with the 2016 season. The Minutemen have subsequently played as an independent through the 2019 season. As of late December 2019, the program's 12-game schedules through the 2022 season are fixed, 10 of 12 games are fixed for both 2023 and 2024, and at least three games per season are fixed out to 2028.",

The team plays its home games at the 7,500 seat Graham Stadium. They are coached by Jason Simpson.\r\n\r\nUT Martin's official mascot became the Skyhawks in 1995. The school lists three references regarding the name, such as the fact that when the school's first site was a Bible institute, the school's athletic teams were called \"sky pilots\", a frontier term for preachers. During World War II, UT Junior College contracted with the Naval War Training Service to help train pilots, who completed their flight training at an airport now near a high school. Also, Red-tail hawks are indigenous to the west Tennessee region. The previous names of the athletic team were the Junior Volunteers and the Pacers.",

The Trailblazers compete as members of the Western Athletic Conference (WAC); in football, the school competes in the second level of D-I football, the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS).\r\n\r\nUtah Tech began competing in NCAA Division II in the 2006\u201307 academic year (as Dixie State) after being a member of the National Junior College Athletic Association. From 1952 to 2009, as part of a general theme of Confederacy symbolism for the university, the school's nickname was the \"Rebels\", which was changed to the \"Red Storm\" in 2009. In 2016, the nickname was changed again to \"Trailblazers\".\r\n\r\nOn January 11, 2019, the university announced that it would move its sports program up to NCAA Division I by joining the WAC for all sports except football, which played as an FCS independent for one year before joining DSU's other sports in the WAC after it reinstated football for the 2021 season. The transition to D-I, which began upon the school's arrival in the WAC on July 1, 2020, will take four years; during this time, the Trailblazers will be ineligible for NCAA-sanctioned postseason play in any of their current sports.\r\n\r\nOn November 10, 2021, the Utah legislature approved the rebranding of the school from Dixie State University to Utah Tech University. The publicly presented name change occurred in May 2022, with the change planned to take legal effect on July 1, 2022.",

Teams for sports sponsored by both campuses will be merged, and DII athletes unable to make the DI teams will either be allowed to continue their athletic scholarships without competing or to be granted waivers that allow them to transfer to another DII school without having to sit out a season.

Five years earlier, in the 2010 NCAA Tournament, the 15th-seed Colonials nearly upset No. 9-ranked Villanova in the First Round before losing in overtime.

Since 1968, the Jaguars have compiled an overall record of 694\u2013507 (.580). Ronnie Arrow returned as head coach in 2007, succeeding John Pelphrey after the 2006\u201307 season. In his three seasons succeeding Pelphrey, Coach Arrow was 63\u201334 (64.9%), and is 177\u2013127 (58.2%) all time at South Alabama. He retired December 19, 2012 and was replaced by Jeff Price on an interim basis. On March 25, 2013, Matthew Graves was named as the new head coach of the Jaguars. On March 8, 2018, Graves was fired after 5 seasons after a 65\u201396 record with no postseason appearances. Exactly 1 week later, the Jaguars hired former Nicholls State head coach Richie Riley for the job. In Coach Riley's first year at the helm of the Jaguars, he led the program to their first non-losing season since 2013, finishing the year at 17-17.",

North Dakota was ineligible for post season play during its transition to Division I from 2008 to 2011.\r\n\r\nNorth Dakota left the Big Sky Conference for all sports in 2018, joining the Summit League. Their football program will join the Missouri Valley Football Conference in 2020. Although being classified as an independent for football in 2018 and 2019, they will continue to play a full Big Sky schedule and their games will count in the conference standings for their opponents but the Fighting Hawks will be ineligible to win the conference championship.",

This moniker has been Western's mascot since 1933.\"What exactly is a Catamount?\" Wild cats of the \"catamount variety\", including the bobcat, cougar or lynx, have roamed the southern Appalachian Mountains for years. But the nickname evolved from a contest that was held on the Cullowhee campus in 1933. The contest came down to Mountain Boomers, a small ground squirrel that scampers about the woods and is extremely difficult to catch, and Catamounts. Head Football Coach C.C. Poindexter selected Catamounts, as he wanted his players to display a \"fierce spirit, savage attacks, and lightning quick moves.\" WCU is one of only two universities in the United States with this mascot (the other is the University of Vermont).\r\n\r\n\"Paws\" the Catamount is the official mascot of Western Carolina University.

The Knights are members of the ASUN Conference for most sports. The Knights had been members of the Division II Great Lakes Valley Conference (GLVC) from its formation in 1978 until joining the ASUN in 2020. Sprint football, a weight-restricted form of American football, will become Bellarmine's 23rd varsity sport in 2022.\r\n\r\nOn June 18, 2019, it was officially announced that the Knights would join the ASUN beginning in the 2020\u201321 school year, starting a four-year transition to NCAA Division I. Four Bellarmine teams in sports that are not sponsored by the ASUN have varied homes. Bellarmine has been a member of the Southern Conference (SoCon) for wrestling since it joined the ASUN. The Knights had also been SoCon members in men's lacrosse, a sport in which they have competed as Division I members since the 2005 season (2004\u201305 school year), before the ASUN reinstated men's lacrosse in the 2022 season. Men's and women's swimming and diving joined the Coastal Collegiate Sports Association, a league with which the ASUN is a partner. Field hockey became a Division I independent for 2020\u201321, and joined the Mid-American Conference as an affiliate member in July 2021. During the transition period, Knights teams other than men's lacrosse are ineligible for NCAA-sanctioned postseason play. Men's lacrosse is not subject to this restriction because it had been a D-I member before the transition.",

        "strDescriptionEN": "The Albany Great Danes football program is the intercollegiate American football team for the University at Albany located in the U.S. state of New York. The team competes in the NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) as a football-only member of the Colonial Athletic Association (CAA). The 2013 season was the Great Danes' first in the CAA, following a 14-year tenure in the Northeast Conference. \r\nAlbany played football as a club sport in the 1920s, but dropped that program in 1924. The modern era of Albany football began in 1970, when the school restored football as a club sport. The team was upgraded to full varsity status in 1973. From the revival of football in 1970 through 2012, the team played its home games at the 10,000 seat University Field in Albany, New York. Albany opened a new 8,500-seat stadium, Bob Ford Field, for the 2013 season. The stadium is named after Bob Ford, who was the Great Danes' head coach from 1970 through 2013. \r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albany_Great_Danes_football",

        "strDescriptionEN": "The Lafayette Leopards football program represents Lafayette College in college football. One of the oldest college football programs in the United States, Lafayette currently plays in the Patriot League at the NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision level. Fielding their first team in 1882, Lafayette has won three college football national championships (1896, 1921, 1926), seven Patriot League championships (1988, 1992, 1994, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2013), six undefeated seasons (1896, 1909, 1921, 1926, 1937, 1940) and four undefeated, untied seasons (1921, 1926, 1937, 1940).\r\n\r\nFor most of its history, Lafayette played an independent schedule until joining the Patriot League in 1986. Between 1929 and 1975, the Leopards were a part of an unofficial conference, the \u201cMiddle Three Conference,\u201d which consisted of Rutgers University and Lehigh University. Today, Lafayette is most noted for its fierce arch-rivalry with Lehigh, which is the most played rivalry in college football (151 games) and the most consecutive years played (since 1897). ESPN considers \"The Rivalry\" to be among the top ten in college football, and was the subject of a PBS documentary narrated by NFL Films voice and Philadelphia Phillies broadcaster Harry Kalas. Aside from Lehigh and Rutgers, Lafayette's primary rivals are Bucknell University and the University of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nLafayette has produced four consensus All-Americans (FBS), 11 FCS All-Americans, four College Football Hall of Fame players, and three College Football Hall of Fame coaches. Lafayette football has produced and nurtured several legendary football personalities, such as George Barclay, inventor of the football helmet, and Jock Sutherland, legendary coach of the Pittsburgh Panthers and Pittsburgh Steelers. Lafayette's Herb McCracken is also credited with inventing the huddle during a game in which Pennsylvania was stealing hand signals.\r\n\r\nLafayette's nickname is the Leopards, dating from October 21, 1924. In its early history, the students, alumni, and press referred to the team as the 'Maroon.' The Leopards are still occasionally referred to as the 'Maroon' or the 'Maroon and White.' Currently, Lafayette has 650 wins, 33rd all-time in Division I.",

Starting in 1896 the Holy Cross Football team played at the Worcester Oval. The first home game played at Holy Cross was a 6\u20130 defeat of Massachusetts Agricultural College on September 26, 1903. In 1908, the football field was moved to next to the baseball field which bears the same name (Fitton Field). Since 1910, the Holy Cross Crusader \"Goodtime\" Marching Band has performed halftime shows at home football games. The original field was built with wooden and concrete stands. These were replaced with steel stands in 1924 and aluminum seating in 1986. The largest crowd ever to pack Fitton Field was the 27,000 who showed up to see Holy Cross's All-American back Bill Osmanski in his last home game in 1938.",

        "strDescriptionEN": "The Saint Francis Red Flash football program represents the intercollegiate football team for Saint Francis University. The team competes in the NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) and are members of the Northeast Conference. The school's first football team was fielded in 1892.:64 The team plays its home games at the 3,500-seat DeGol Field. They are coached by Chris Villarrial.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nThe name dates back to 1927, when the school boasted one of the fastest football ground attacks in the east, headed by quarterback George Kunzler, captain and right halfback Ed McLister, fullback Alphonse Abels and left halfback Ralph Bruno. Because the team wore predominantly red uniforms, the fans and The Loretto (the student newspaper) dubbed the team \"The Red Flashes.\"\r\n\r\nThe nickname quickly spread, first to the football team and later that same season to the basketball team. Within 15 years, \"The Red Flashes\" evolved into the present form of \"The Red Flash,\" through the efforts of sports publicist Simon \"Cy\" Bender.\r\n\r\nBefore The Red Flashes romped on the football field, the school's teams went by a variety of unofficial nicknames, with the most popular being the \"Saints.\" Others were derived from a Franciscan theme, such as the \"Franciscans\" and \"Frannies.\"\r\n\r\nThe most popular unofficial nickname also evolved from the Franciscan theme, with its origins dating back to the 1930s. The nickname \"Frankies\" can be traced as far back as the 1938\u201339 basketball season, when the name first appeared in The Loretto and the Johnstown Tribune-Democrat. The rise of this nickname can be closely tied to the University's Mr. Frankie Award, given annually to an outstanding senior male, which dates to 1936.\r\n\r\nThe \"Gigity\" nickname gained widespread use by fans and the then-college but was discontinued after the 1971\u201372 season, giving way to the current \"Red Flash\" moniker. The change coincided with the opening of the Maurice Stokes Athletics Center.\r\n\r\nSaint Francis\u2019 athletics tradition dates back to 1867 when a group of students formed a team called the Independent Star-Athletic Association. The team played its first game under the Saint Francis banner in 1888. Gymnastics was established in 1882, while football was first played at Saint Francis University in 1892.\r\n\r\nThe name \"Red Flash\" is unique among NCAA Division I schools.",
